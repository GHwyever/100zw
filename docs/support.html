    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <h3>1. How do I restore my purchase?</h3>
    <p>If you have purchased "Lifetime Access" but the app is locked (e.g., after reinstalling), go to the <strong>Settings</strong> page or the purchase screen and tap the <strong>"Restore Purchases"</strong> button. Ensure you are logged in with the same Apple ID used for the original purchase.</p>

    <h3>2. No sound is playing?</h3>
    <p>Please check if your device is in "Silent Mode" (the physical switch on the side of your iPhone). Also, ensure your volume is turned up. The app uses the system's text-to-speech engine, which requires an active internet connection for the best quality, though basic functionality may work offline.</p>

    <h3>3. Microphone permission denied?</h3>
    <p>If you accidentally denied microphone permission, go to your iPhone's <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone</strong>, find "100 Phrases," and toggle the switch to ON.</p>

    <h3>4. Is this a subscription?</h3>
    <p>No. Our "Lifetime Access" is a one-time purchase. You pay once and keep it forever, including all future updates.</p>
